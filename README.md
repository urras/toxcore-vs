How to build:
1. Define GARGBAGE environment variable (path to any folder - all temprary stuff and builded libraries will be stored here)
2. Install Visual Studio 2013 Express (if not yet)
3. run build_libs.cmd

Another way - create solution and add project (*.vcxproj) files, then build from VS gui

PS. There are yasm64.exe in vpx folder - it necessary to build asm files of vpx lib. So, if you use 32 bit windows, you have to download yasm32 here: http://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html
